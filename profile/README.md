Reveal Market is a privacy‑first prediction markets platform built around commit/reveal. Participation is anonymized by default, and only final outcomes and winning claims are revealed on-chain.

## The problem
Prediction markets are powerful, but most platforms expose participant behavior, leak intent through order flow, and require users to trust opaque settlement. For many users, this creates unnecessary risk and discourages participation.

## What Reveal Market solves
- **Privacy‑preserving participation** through commit/reveal
- **Minimal on‑chain exposure**: only winning claims need to be public
- **Clear, verifiable settlement** without revealing losers’ positions
- **Simple user experience** that still delivers strong security guarantees

## Privacy guarantees (high level)
- Positions are committed without revealing the choice up front.
- Only winners need to reveal to claim; non‑winning positions can remain unrevealed.
- Settlement is verifiable on‑chain without exposing every participant’s position.

## How it works (high level)
1. Users commit to a position without revealing their choice.
2. Markets resolve based on transparent criteria.
3. Commitments are verified, and only winners reveal to claim.
4. Settlement is verifiable and on‑chain, without exposing losers.

## What’s live today
- End‑to‑end testnet‑ready flow (quote → commit → settle → claim)
- Real‑time market and FX data feeding quotes
- Demo UI with trading and proof visibility

## Roadmap (next)
- Mainnet readiness hardening (auth, monitoring, ops runbooks)
- Production‑grade settlement and proof throughput
- Expanded market coverage and UX polish
